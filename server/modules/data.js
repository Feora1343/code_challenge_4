  // in this data as well as sort it, thinking to hard mode. Furthermore, how 
  // were we going to sort by name? Using the weekend challenge 4 as a reference,
  // I am giving the property name to the objects in the array. Then I am going to
  // create a module file, move this file to the module file and export it as the
  // array name so the client can use it."
